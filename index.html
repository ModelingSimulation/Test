    <h3> Description</h3>
    This course will provide graduate students preparing for teaching
    and research careers with several skills and tools for more
    effective professional oral and written presentation. It will also
    provide a platform for supervised teaching practice. Students from
    all fields of mathematics are welcome, both pure and applied. The
    first part of the course, taught primarily by Prof. Mutiara
    Sondjaja, will focus on teaching pedagogy and effective class
    management. The second part of the course, co-taught with Prof.
    Aleks Donev, will focus on scientific writing, from abstracts to
    complete papers. Students will practice both by writing a review
    article or lecture notes on a topic from their field of study, aimed
    at their peers and not at specialists. They will deliver lectures to
    the class on the chosen topic and get feedback from the instructors
    and other students. The use of LaTex or tools based on LaTex such as
    LyX or sharelatex/Overleaf will be strongly encouraged. We will also
    have some guest lectures from professional writers and career
    service professionals, and will provide, as time permits, help with
    basic job search skills like writing CVs, teaching and research
    statements, and cover letters. Students will be encouraged to help
    each other and learn from peers.<br>

    <h3><a name="Tools"></a>Tools</h3>
    Each of you will be required to write a set of "lecture notes" in
    LaTex. It is essential that you setup a working <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive">LaTex environment</a> (for OS X
    use <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">MACTex</a> and consider
    installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>) on the
    computing system you wish to use for this course (the Linux-based
    CIMS networked computers have everything you need and more).
    First-time LaTex users (but also others!) should consider using the
    WYSIWYG Latex frontend / word processor <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> to start. Students that prefer
    to work directly with LaTex should take a look at some
    latex-specific editors, such as the free and portable <a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index.html">TeXMaker</a>
    (installed on Courant's linux network). More experienced users could
    use a programming editor that is latex-aware, such as <a href="https://atom.io/packages/latex">atom-latex</a> or <a href="https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">LaTeXTools-sublime</a>.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to make presentations in PowerPoint or keynote and
    include equations, try <a href="https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/">LatexIt</a> (comes
    with MACTex on OS X systems).<br>
    <br>
    To co-edit and comment on this as a group, we will use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, and/or maybe <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>+TeX editor of choice.<br>
    <br>

    <b>Elevator statements</b> are discussed on page 154 in Chapter 13
    (The Big Picture) of the book Stylish Academic Writing. Here is what
    Sword has to say about it:<br>
    "Condensing a complex research project into a pithy abstract is no
    simple task, to be sure. An even greater challenge is to boil that
    abstract down into an “elevator statement”: the seemingly
    off-the-cuff but in fact brilliantly polished single-sentence sum-
    mary that you offer to the colleague who turns to you in the
    elevator at an academic conference and asks, “So what are you
    working on?” You have just a minute or two to respond: the time that
    it takes for the elevator to arrive at its destination floor...The
    secret ingredient of an effective elevator statement—or, for that
    matter, of a persuasive abstract, article, or book—is a strong
    thesis or argument. Both words are frequently heard in the freshman
    composition classroom but seldom in the research laboratory.
    However, identical principles apply in both venues: writers who put
    forth a bold, defensible claim are much more likely to generate
    engaging, persuasive prose than those who of- fer bland statements
    of fact with which no one could possibly disagree. In the sciences
    and social sciences, a strong thesis fol- lows naturally from a
    compelling research question..."<br>
    <br>
    Homework: <i>Prepare a 2-3min elevator talk. Choose your topic
      (e.g., your own research, field of math) and audience. Try one
      more specialized and one less specialized audience (e.g., a
      colleague and a neighbor). Present in class and put it on Piazza
      for comment.</i><br>
